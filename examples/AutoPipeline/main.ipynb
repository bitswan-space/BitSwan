    "Say you want to create a quick linear pipeline that just takes events from one data source, transforms those events, and sends them on to a data sink. Since we're thinking in a straight line, we can think of the jupyter notebook itself as a pipeline. In the simplest case, events would come in at the top of the notebook, are processed, and then come out the bottom.\n",

The special variable `event` will be set in the pipeline after the `auto_pipeline` call. This variable will also be sent to the sink at the end of the pipeline.\n"
